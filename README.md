This is collaborative work on creating a toolbox to visualize the search in graphs using uninformed search algorithms: Breadth first search, Depth first search and Uniform cost search
and an informed search algorithm: A* search
The toolbox contain also a  chess game that works with minimax algorithm.

  Guidlines:
                     
- Enter  start and goal states for a well-structured representation of the problem space.
- Construct search trees or graphs , input edges and associated costs in a specified format in the label entry “ input your graph “ , such as "1 2 3" denoting a path from node 1 to node 2 with a cost of 3 each line will consist of an edge .
- Choose one algorithm from the provided list from the label “search algorithm”.
- In case of choosing an informed search algorithm you have to enter heuristic values for each node using the " input Heuristic values " label  in this specific format
  “ node  heuristic-value” for exemple 1 3 that means that node 1 has heuristic value 3 each line will define the heuristic value of a node .
- Initiate the search process clicking on the start button , then the graph will be displayed showing the path taken by the search algorithm in a different color .

   Note: Our solution works with numeric values, nodes need to be represented as numbers.
